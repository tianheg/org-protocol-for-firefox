org-protocol
============

Provides a Firefox address bar button to send the current webpage to
Emacs `org-mode` via [org-protocol][1].  It's mostly a quick and dirty
replacement for the `org-protocol` bookmarklet that was less and less
useful because of CSP (Content Security Policy) blocking them on many
sites (for example Github).  This addon does not suffer from this
limitation.

USAGE
-----

Either press the address bar button or press the hotkey
(<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+E</kbd> by default) and then confirm by clicking the
popup (or pressing <kbd>Space</kbd>/<kbd>Enter</kbd>) to send the
current page to Emacs with `org-protocol`.  The configuration specific
to `org-protocol` is almost certainly needed, please refer to its
documentation.

PERMISSIONS
-----------

This addon requires the "Access your data for all websites"
permission.  It's used solely to extract the currently selected text
to pass it to `org-capture`, see
[thisÂ file](https://github.com/vifon/org-protocol-for-firefox/blob/master/content-script.js)
for the details.
